User authentication is handled through a JSON file that stores username–password pairs.

## How It Works

### **1. User Login**
Credentials are stored in `ID_PASS.json` like:
```json
{
  "user1": "password1"
}
```

### **2. User Profile Submission**
Details submitted via Streamlit UI are saved into `Login_info.csv`.

### **3. Info Display**
`Correct_info_page.py` displays or verifies stored data.
